This folder contains Kevin Lindsey's SVG geometry library with the addition of a little bit of slightly gnarly hacking to get elliptical arc support.
The code for converting from elliptical arcs to cubic beziers comes from the raphael project (again considerably modified).
Any bugs in the path routines are probably a result of my hastiness and not the fault of the original author.

All modifications are constrained to AbsoluteArcToPathSegment.js and Path.js and should be clearly marked.


The library is needed to work around the lack of a working implementation of checkIntersection() in webkit;  at some point it should be possible to use the built in method.
